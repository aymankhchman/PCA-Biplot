This module will produce a biplot of the projected points in the space of 2D which correspond to the first two principal components and the direction of each variable. You'll only need pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.


The transform variable will give you a different result than the function pca in sklearn because sklearn just centralize, where here for the sake of the visualization the module will standarize the data.
